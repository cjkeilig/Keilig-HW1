# Sails Finance

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

This is an old fork of a now-priate repository, current development is being done in the private repository.

This SailsJS application is a simple financial management tool built on NodeJS.
The application is configured for MySQL or Postgres but can be ported to use other datasources with the various database drivers for the Waterline ORM.


`npm install` is required to load the driver, but all other javascript libraries are included. (Bootstrap, jQuery, D3)
Future enhancements include using bower for client side libraries and integrating with the sails build process.
